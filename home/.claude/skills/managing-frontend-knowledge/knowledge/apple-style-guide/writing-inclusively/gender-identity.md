# Gender Identity

Gender identity guidelines for inclusive writing in Apple documentation.

## Key Principles

### 1. Avoid binary gender language
When possible, avoid binary gender language. Instead of "men and women," use "people."

### 2. Gender-neutral pronouns are acceptable
The guide states "it's OK to use _they_, _their_, or _them_ as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun" for individuals of unspecified gender.

### 3. Context matters
References to specific genders are acceptable when contextually necessary, such as "Women should earn the same as men for comparable work."

### 4. Don't assume pronouns
The guidance indicates that individuals may use "he/him," "she/her," "they/them," other pronouns, or no pronouns—ask when uncertain.

### 5. Gender-neutral titles
Some people prefer titles like "Mx." rather than gendered alternatives. When writing about real people, ask what title they prefer.

## Examples

**Avoid:** "Hiring men and women of diverse backgrounds fosters innovation"

**Preferable:** "Hiring people of diverse backgrounds fosters innovation"

The section emphasizes that rewriting sentences using plural forms or omitting pronouns entirely offers alternative solutions to avoid gender-specific language.
