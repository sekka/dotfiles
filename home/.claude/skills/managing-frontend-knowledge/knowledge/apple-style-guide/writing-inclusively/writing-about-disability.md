# Writing about Disability

Apple's guidance emphasizes focusing on individuals' accomplishments and authentic stories rather than their disabilities unless essential to the content.

## Key Principles

### Language Preference
The guide distinguishes between identity-first language ("an autistic person") and person-first language ("a person on the autism spectrum"). Preferences vary, so directly asking individuals about their preferred terminology is recommended.

### Scope of Disability
"It's helpful to think about disability on a spectrum" with recognition that individuals may experience conditions differently and possess multiple disabilities simultaneously.

### Ableist Language to Avoid
Don't characterize non-disabled individuals as "normal" or "healthy." Avoid depicting disability as something to "overcome" or labeling people with disabilities as "brave" or "inspiring," as this risks being condescending.

### Sensory-Specific Instructions
Replace phrases like "you see a message" with neutral descriptions: "A message appears." Avoid disability-related idioms with negative connotations.

### Acceptable Common Phrases
Standard expressions ("I see your point," "watch your favorite movies") remain appropriate, as audiences generally understand their conventional meaning.

## Terminology Guide

The resource provides a detailed table comparing preferred identity-first and person-first terms across various disabilities—from blindness to autism to neurodivergence—while noting that individual preferences should always take precedence over general guidelines.
