# Inclusive Representation

The Apple Style Guide emphasizes that content creators should recognize the diverse backgrounds of Apple product users and actively represent this variety in their work.

## Using Diverse Names in Examples

The guide provides sample names reflecting various ethnicities and gender presentations:

**Given names:** "Blair, Étienne, Guillermo, Lee, Mayuri, Priyanka, Shannon, Yen"

**Family names:** "Kawashima, Lai, McNeil, Melnykova, Salinas, Sears, Zhao"

The guide notes that Western name structures (given + family) don't apply universally, and some cultures use multiple family names.

## Avoiding Bias and Stereotypes

### Bias considerations
- Include varied ethnicities, genders, ages, body types, and abilities when depicting people in occupations
- Represent cultural examples beyond Western traditions
- Avoid depicting only affluent lifestyles

### Stereotype avoidance
Content should not rely on fixed beliefs about groups based on characteristics like gender, race, ability, or age. The guide specifically mentions avoiding narrow family representations, instead including "a variety of family types."
