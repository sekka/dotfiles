# General Guidelines for Inclusive Writing

Inclusive writing guidelines from Apple's official style guide, focusing on how to communicate respectfully and accessibly.

## Key Principles

### Perspective and Intent
Writers should "think about your potential audience" and consider how terminology might be received, recognizing that "words can sometimes carry meanings you don't intend."

### Language Research
Investigating word origins matters; the guide notes that "some common expressions (like grandfathered in) arose from oppressive or exclusionary contexts."

### Contextual Appropriateness
Terms may be acceptable in some situations but inappropriate in others—for example, "mute" works for devices but not for describing nonspeaking individuals.

### Problematic Terminology to Avoid
- Violent language like "kill" or "hang"
- Oppressive terms like "master" and "slave"
- Ableist phrases such as "sanity check"

### Language Accessibility
"Common sayings...can be difficult to understand for people who are learning the language" and complicate translation efforts.

### Color Symbolism
Avoid associating colors with moral values (e.g., "blacklist," "white hat"). Use color descriptions only for literal visual elements.

### Conservative Approach
"If you're not sure about a term...choose a different term," as alternatives usually exist.
