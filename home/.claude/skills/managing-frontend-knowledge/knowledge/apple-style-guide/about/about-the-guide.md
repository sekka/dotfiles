# About This Guide

The **Apple Style Guide** establishes editorial standards for Apple's instructional materials, technical documentation, reference content, training programs, and user interfaces. Its primary purpose is maintaining consistent voice across Apple communications.

## Primary Audience

The guide serves:
- Writers and editors creating Apple materials
- Developers building user-facing applications
- Third-party developers following Apple standards

## Key Reference Resources

Apple recommends consulting:
- *Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary* for spelling
- *The Chicago Manual of Style* for style and usage questions

When these sources conflict, *The Chicago Manual of Style* takes precedence for style matters, while *Merriam-Webster's* governs spelling decisions.

## Important Notes

- Guidelines reflect **U.S. English conventions**
- Localized content requires region-specific resources
- Some Apple departments maintain supplemental guides
- The guide emphasizes **hyphenation rules**: compounds are hyphenated before nouns but often not in predicate positions

## Access

Users can access the guide online or download it as a PDF document.

## Feedback Process

Apple employees and registered developers can request revisions via bugreport.apple.com. Others may contact ASGFeedback@group.apple.com.
