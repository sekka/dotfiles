# Code Font in Text

Rules for formatting code within body text in Apple materials.

## When to Use Code Font

Use code font for:
- Variable names
- Function and method names
- Class and type names
- File names and paths
- URLs and domain names
- Command-line commands
- Configuration values
- API endpoints

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use monospace font for all code elements
- Maintain normal sentence punctuation around code
- Don't italicize code font
- Keep code font consistent throughout document

## Integration with Text

- Code elements should flow naturally in sentences
- Use articles (a, an, the) appropriately with code terms
- Maintain grammatical correctness around code elements

## Examples

**Good**: "The `viewDidLoad()` method is called when the view controller loads."

**Good**: "Set the `isEnabled` property to `true` to enable the feature."

**Avoid**: Mixing code font with other formatting like bold or italic
