# Placeholder Names in Text

Conventions for representing variable or placeholder terms in Apple materials.

## Purpose

Placeholder names help readers understand:
- Where to substitute their own values
- What type of information is expected
- Context-specific variable requirements

## Formatting

- Use italic font for placeholder names
- Choose descriptive, self-explanatory names
- Use camelCase or snake_case consistently
- Make placeholders clearly distinguishable from literal values

## Common Patterns

### Examples of Placeholders

- *username*: For user account names
- *filename*: For file names
- *path*: For file system paths
- *value*: For generic values
- *appName*: For application names
- *yourDomain*: For domain names

## Usage in Syntax

When showing syntax with placeholders:
- Clearly distinguish required vs. optional placeholders
- Provide examples with real values
- Explain what each placeholder represents

## Best Practices

- Use consistent placeholder naming throughout documentation
- Avoid ambiguous placeholder names
- Include units or formats when relevant (e.g., *date-YYYY-MM-DD*)
- Provide clear definitions for all placeholders
