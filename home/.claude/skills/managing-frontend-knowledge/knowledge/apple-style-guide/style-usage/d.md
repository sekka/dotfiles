# Section D

Terminology, usage, and formatting conventions for Apple materials beginning with "D".

## Key Entries

**Dark Mode**: "Users can _turn on_ or _turn off_ Dark Mode and _use_ Dark Mode. Don't describe a computer or device as _using Dark Mode_."

**Dates**: Use commas between day and year (June 9, 2025). Use cardinal numbers with months but ordinal numbers without (August 12 vs. the 12th).

**Deafblind/Deaf**: Lowercase for medical conditions; capitalize when referring to cultural identity. Avoid outdated terms like "deaf-mute."

**Disable/Disabled**: Don't use for turning off features. Instead use "turn off" or "deselect" for actions, and "turned off" or "unavailable" for states.

**Digital Crown**: Always use the complete term; users "turn" it, not "rotate" it.

**Drag**: On touchscreens, avoid "tap and drag"; use "drag" alone. Never say "drag your finger."

**DRM**: Stands for "digital rights management."

**Dual-Core**: Processors have "dual cores," not "a dual core."
