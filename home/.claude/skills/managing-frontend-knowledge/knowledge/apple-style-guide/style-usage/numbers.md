# Numbers

Apple's style guidelines for numerical notation and technical abbreviations.

## Key Guidelines

### 2-Byte vs. Double-Byte Character
The guide specifies: "Don't use; use _double-byte character_" for the term 2-byte character.

### Dimensional Abbreviations
- **2D and 3D**: Both abbreviations require no hyphens
- **2K through 8K**: These denote horizontal screen resolution in thousands of pixels without spacing (e.g., "5K display")

### Resolution Examples
The document provides: "The 27-inch iMac has a Retina 5K display" as sample usage for resolution terminology.

### Touch Technology Terms
**3D Touch** describes older iPhone functionality enabling feature access through display pressure. The guide notes newer models employ Haptic Touch instead.

### Network Standards
Ethernet designations include 10Base-T, 100Base-T, and 1000Base-T formats with specific capitalization requirements.

### Time Expression
The guide recommends **24/7** over "24x7" and suggests spelling it as "24 hours a day, 7 days a week" for expanded usage.
