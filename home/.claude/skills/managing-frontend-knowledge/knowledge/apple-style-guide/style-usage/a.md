# Section A

Comprehensive style guide for terminology, usage conventions, and writing standards for Apple product documentation beginning with the letter "A".

## Abbreviations & Acronyms
The guide emphasizes spelling out unfamiliar terms on first occurrence. For example: "internet service provider (ISP)" with the abbreviation in parentheses. File type abbreviations use capitals (JPEG, MP3), while extensions are lowercase (.jpg, .mp3).

## Product Naming Conventions
- Never abbreviate Apple product names
- Use "Apple Watch," "Apple TV," and "AirPods" without articles in general references
- For models, use numbers: "AirPods Pro 2" rather than generation descriptions

## Technical Terminology
The guide distinguishes between related terms:
- "Access" should be replaced with more specific verbs like "log in to" or "connect to"
- "Appear" is preferred over "display" for screen visibility
- "Administrator account" describes system access levels; avoid using "administrator" alone for macOS users

## Writing Style Principles
Replace passive constructions with active voice. For instance: "You can create a database with FileMaker Pro" instead of "FileMaker Pro allows you to create a database."

## Accessibility
Accessibility features receive specific capitalization: "VoiceOver," "AssistiveTouch," "Zoom," and similar features are proper nouns in Apple documentation.

## Service Names
Apple differentiates between product names and service descriptions—"Apple Music" (the service) versus "the Music app" (the interface).
