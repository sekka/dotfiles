# Section E

Terminology, usage guidelines, and writing conventions for terms beginning with "E".

## Key Style Guidelines

### e- Prefix Terms
Hyphenate electronic terms: "e-commerce," "e-learning." Exceptions: "email" and "ebook" remain unhyphenated.

### Audio Equipment
- "earbuds" — one word
- "earphones" — one word
- "ear tip" — lowercase for silicone AirPods Pro tips

### Software Version References
Use "earlier" or "later" when discussing software versions, not "newer" or "older."

### Editing Terminology
No hyphen when "editing" functions as a compound adjective: "video editing app," "audio editing system."

### Education Sector
Reference education customers in lowercase: "K–12 education," "higher education." Avoid abbreviations like "ed," "edu," or "HED."

### Email Standards
- One word, used for noun, verb, and adjective forms
- Email addresses use "username@domain" format
- Acceptable to end sentences with periods after email addresses

### Terminology Corrections
- Use "embed" not "imbed"
- "eject" functions as transitive verb only
- Use "ensure" (guarantee); "insure" (insurance context)
- "enter" describes inputting information; "type" means pressing keys
- Avoid "entitled"; use "titled," "named," or "called"

### Emoji Usage
Lowercase, same singular/plural form. Use with regular punctuation in running text, though exceptions exist for special contexts like notifications.

### UI Elements
- "Environments View" — capitalize when referring to Apple Vision Pro feature
- "EyeSight" — technology showing eyes on front display (don't precede with "the")
- "Eject button" — specific interface element

### File Formats
"EPUB" functions as adjective only; never use as noun for electronic books.

### Common Mistakes
Avoid "enable" when meaning "turn on"; these have different implications regarding immediate action versus preparatory tasks.
