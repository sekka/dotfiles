# Section M

Apple's official style guidelines for terms beginning with the letter "M".

## Key Terms and Guidelines

### Mac Products
Use "Mac" for computers and related products. Don't pluralize or use possessive forms of trademark names. Avoid calling computers "machines" or "PCs."

**Example**: "Get to know Mac" (not "the Mac")

### Mac Operating Systems
Use "macOS" for current versions (10.12+). Features are "in" macOS, not "on" macOS. Include version names before numbers when both appear.

**Example**: "macOS Sierra 10.12"

### App Store References
Apps are found "in," "on," or "from" the Mac App Store. Don't abbreviate as "MAS."

### Inclusive Language Guidance
Avoid gendered or problematic terms:
- Replace "man hours" with "people hours"
- Use "unstaffed" instead of "unmanned"
- Avoid "master/slave" terminology; use "primary/secondary" or "host/client"

### Technical Terms
- **Memory**: Refers to RAM, ROM, virtual memory—not storage capacity
- **Mount**: Acceptable in technical materials; avoid in user documentation
- **Mouse**: De-emphasize; focus on actions like "clicking" instead
- **Mode**: Avoid overusing; omit when unnecessary

### M-Series Chips
Refers to Apple's systems on a chip (SoCs). Reference as "Mac with M4 chip" rather than "M4 Mac."

This guide ensures consistent, clear technical communication across Apple's documentation.
