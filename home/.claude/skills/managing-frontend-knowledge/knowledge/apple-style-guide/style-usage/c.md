# Section C

Comprehensive style guide for terminology beginning with the letter "C".

## Key Entries

### Cable vs. Cord
"Use _cable_ to describe what physically connects two pieces of hardware." Reserve _cord_ for power cords and phone cords specifically.

### Capitalization Standards
Apple employs two primary styles:
- **Sentence-style**: Standard capitalization after periods
- **Title-style**: Capitalizes nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions

Guidelines specify not capitalizing articles, coordinating conjunctions, or prepositions under four letters unless they're part of phrasal verbs.

### Checkbox Usage
Instructions should use "select" or "deselect" rather than "check" or "uncheck." The guide provides examples: "Select the checkbox labeled 'Allow repeated calls.'"

### Command Terminology
"A command is _in_ a menu, not _on_ a menu; a menu _contains_ commands." Users _choose_ rather than _select_ commands.

### Contractions
Apple recommends using common contractions throughout documentation as part of its informal voice, including constructions like "aren't," "isn't," and "there's," while avoiding contractions from nouns or colloquialisms.

### Technical Terms
- **Cache**: Note the specific spelling for cached/caching
- **Codec**: Not capitalized; short for compressor/decompressor
- **Code Font**: Used for user-typed text, code listings, and language elements
- **CPU**: Avoid in user materials; use "processor" instead

### Color References
Avoid "colored" when describing screen items; instead use specific color names or the term "color" descriptively.

### Contextual Menus
In user materials, use "shortcut menu" rather than "contextual menu," though parenthetical identification of the latter term is acceptable on first reference.

## Style Principles

The guide emphasizes clarity, precision, and accessibility. It distinguishes between user-facing materials and developer documentation, providing appropriate terminology for each context. Consistency in formatting and terminology across documents is paramount.
