# Units of Measure (International Style)

Guidelines for using units of measurement in international contexts.

## Measurement Systems

### Metric System (SI)
- Used in most countries worldwide
- Based on meters, grams, liters
- Decimal-based conversions

### Imperial System
- Primarily used in United States
- Based on feet, pounds, gallons
- Non-decimal conversions

## Best Practices

### For International Audiences
- Use metric units as primary measurement
- Provide imperial equivalents in parentheses when relevant
- Example: "5 km (3.1 miles)"

### For US Audiences
- Imperial units may be primary
- Include metric equivalents for technical documentation
- Example: "10 feet (3 meters)"

## Common Conversions

### Length
- 1 inch = 2.54 cm
- 1 foot = 30.48 cm
- 1 mile = 1.609 km

### Weight
- 1 ounce = 28.35 g
- 1 pound = 0.454 kg

### Volume
- 1 fluid ounce = 29.57 mL
- 1 gallon (US) = 3.785 L

## Formatting

- Include space between number and unit
- Use standard abbreviations consistently
- Specify system when ambiguity might exist

## Regional Considerations

- Temperature: Celsius vs. Fahrenheit
- Paper sizes: A4 (international) vs. Letter (US)
- Screen sizes: May use inches internationally
