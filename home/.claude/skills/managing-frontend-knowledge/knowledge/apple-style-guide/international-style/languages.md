# Languages

Guidelines for referencing languages in Apple materials.

## Language Names

- Capitalize language names: English, Spanish, Japanese, Mandarin
- Use standard language names recognized internationally
- Specify regional variants when necessary (e.g., British English, Latin American Spanish)

## Language Codes

- Use ISO 639 language codes in technical contexts
- Common codes: en (English), es (Spanish), ja (Japanese), fr (French)
- Include region codes when needed: en-US, en-GB, es-ES, es-MX

## Localization References

- Refer to "localized" content, not "translated" when appropriate
- Acknowledge cultural adaptation beyond literal translation
- Use "locale" for language-region combinations

## Best Practices

- Be respectful of language diversity
- Avoid implying language hierarchy
- Use neutral terms for language variants
- Consider that many users are multilingual
- Don't assume English proficiency

## Writing About Languages

- "In [language]" rather than "the [language] language" (e.g., "in Japanese" not "the Japanese language")
- Capitalize language-derived adjectives only when referring to the language itself
- Use appropriate terminology for writing systems (Latin alphabet, kanji, Cyrillic)
